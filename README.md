# DotNetCoreApiMsTest
This sample solution demonstrates how we can use MS Test in a .NET API project.

Writing unit test cases for your .NET Core API is easy with MS Test. This sample application demostrates how you can create a test project to test your API.
For this sample project, I have used Autofac DI, Dapper ORM and Serilog for logging.
The beauty of this approach of creating a test project is that it uses the same Startup.cs (SampleDotNetCoreApiTest\TestStartup.cs is just a copy of Startup.cs in main application) file to initialize the test project so that your dependencies are injected the way it does in an actual project.
Also, if you want, you can mock our any repository or external API calls.

I have used Moq to mock the repository in the sample project so that it just validates just the controller and business logic without hitting the database.

Why not xUnit?
xUnit is an excellent choice but does not have AssemblyInitialize like MS Test. AssemblyInitialize is a nice place to put all initalization logic for your test cases.

# New Commit
Don't know how the test project was missed. Adding it again.
Also, added OpenCover to check code coverage. Run "DotNetCoreApiMsTest\SampleDotNetCoreApiTest\TestRunner2.cmd" from command prompt to check code coverage of your test cases.
